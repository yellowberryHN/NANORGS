# NANORGS

This is a historical archive of the source code used for the
[2006 Symantec University Programming Competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20060224022835/http://www.symantec.com/specprog/university/).

The contents of this branch are exactly as they were release in 2006 on SourceForge, under the name of
[Simulated Virtual World](https://sourceforge.net/projects/virtual-world/), with the addition of this README,
and a LICENSE file, containing a copy of the license located in the heading of every source file.

This code will not compile as is on modern systems, due to usage of deprecated and removed features in compilers.

The included Visual Studio project file was created with Visual Studio .NET 2003, and the Linux executable was
originally compiled on Red Hat Linux using GCC 3.2.3. The Mac executable was compiled for PowerPC on presumably
whatever version of Mac OS X was the one being used in 2006, also using GCC.
