# NANORGS

This is an updated fork of the source code used for the
[2006 Symantec University Programming Competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20060224022835/http://www.symantec.com/specprog/university/).

The goal for this branch is to allow the code to be compiled on modern systems, as well as potentially fixing
bugs and adding new features in the future.
